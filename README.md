# Student progress tracking thingy

That's a lil program written in C++. It also uses Dear ImGui as ui library.
I made it to play around with c++ and Postgresql db(~~i was forced to do that, im sorry~~).

All you can do there is just look at list of students and click on "More info"
button to see more detailed info about student. Also it has a sql editor.
You can raw dawg your squeal in there.
